## ðŸ“Š Key Insights

- Some high-return indexes show **high volatility** and are unstable under small market shocks.
- A **decision matrix** was built to integrate:
  - Return  
  - Risk  
  - Forecast stability  
- High stability indexes may provide **more reliable short-term returns** than the highest-return options.
